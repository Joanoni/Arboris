# Arboris Summary Interpretation Guidelines
## 1. Cumulative State Integration
- Treat summaries as a continuous building of requirements.
- **Equal Authority:** Decisions at any level are binding.
## 2. Temporal Authority
- If summaries conflict, the one appearing **latest** in the sequence is authoritative.
## 3. Extraction of Operational Constraints
- Identify mandatory requirements and consensus to avoid regression.
